        text: "Argumentation is embodied in human behavior. It is an intelligent communication task aiming at increasing or decreasing the acceptability of a controversial claim or point of view (Moens, 2018). Convincing others by bringing up arguments supporting or attacking the claims builds the basis to discursive activity as it is crucial in legal reasoning.\n"+
        "Because human argumentation is expressed in natural language and strongly context-dependent, the ability to conduct contextual discussions was unique to humans. What if machines can be taught to identify and extract arguments from human discursive activity presented in natural language?"

        section: "Problem",
        text:
            "Case law plays an important role in legal argumentation and decision-making, especially in countries with legal systems using common law (Milward, Mochales, Moens, & Wyner, 2010). Lawyers need to dig into documents of past judicial decisions and identify previous decisions supporting their side in the legal dispute and undermining the other.\n"+
            "The analysis of these documents requires skill and a lot of time: Cases are expressed in natural language, consider highly complex matters under dispute and have complex inter-relationships while the number of documents is constantly growing. Moreover, navigating the documents, interpreting, and applying the results successfully needs extensive training.\n"+
            "These factors can furthermore lead to extensive costs of legal proceedings because of additional working hours and high skill fees of lawyers."

            "The combination of the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Law (Cabrio & Villata 2018) offer an instrument to help lawyers manage and search through the existing case law: Argumentation mining. Its goal is to extract claims and premises by searching case law and recognizing arguments, properties and relationships (Milward, Mochales, Moens, & Wyner, 2010). \n" +
            "\n" +
            "This is where LAWrgMin comes into play: LAWrgMin aims at extracting natural language arguments and their relations (five years of argument mining”) from legal documents. It is able to transform unstructured texts to structured arguments by clause recognition, clause relation prediction and premise/claim recognition and to present the result in a sorted comprehensive way. While lawyers normally must invest hours into the task of manually go through and annotating case law, LAWrgMin solves this in seconds and provides claims and linked premises from the uploaded legal documents. \n",
